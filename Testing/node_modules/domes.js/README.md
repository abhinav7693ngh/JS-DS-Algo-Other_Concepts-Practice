## Introduction

If you want to give boost to your javascript code or always afraid of implementing complex data structures then this is the perfect library for you to use. Domes has implementations of many useful extended data structures like Singly Linked List, Doubly Liked List, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees and many more which if smartly used can give your javascript code an edge in terms of performance and time complexity. We have also implemented many possible methods for these data structures that might be helpful in doing your daily tasks. So rest assured and use efficiently to get best results out of it. These implementations are based on basic fundamentals of these data structures.

Currently we have implementations of below data structures which you can use.
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary Search Tree
* Binary Heaps
    * Max Binary Heap
    * Min Binary Heap
* Priority Queues
    * Max Priority Queue
    * Min Priority Queue
* Graphs
    * Unweighted Undirected Graph (UWUD)
    * Unweighted Directed Graph (UWD)
    * Weighted Undirected Graph (WUD)
    * Weighted Directed Graph (WD)


We have implemented these data structures as classes.

*IF Built in methods don't suffice the needs then you are free to dive in and create your own extended methods for these classes.*

*Suggestions are always welcomed for improvements.*

## Binary Search Tree

As Binary Search Tree work on the fundamental of values greater or less than a value in terms of storing data, So in our implementation currently you can store data either in number or string format as of now and there are 2 comparison methods also. So when making a Binary Search Tree object you have to pass the configuration in the constructor.

**Available types of data that can be stored.**

    1. Number
    2. String

**Comparison methods.**

    1. Normal Comparion (>,<)
        1. In Number config it simply compares whether the number is greater or small.
        2. In String config it compares according to the ASCII value to check which string is greater or small.
    2. Length Comparsion
        1. Not present in Number config.
        2. In String config it compares according to the length of String to check which string is greater or small.

* **Available Configurations.**
    * 1 , 1 - It means you can store only number format and comparsion will be normal comparsion.
    * 2 , 1 - It means you can store only string format and comparsion will be normal comparison.
    * 2 , 2 - It means you can store only string format and comparsion will be based on length of string.

> You have to pass these configuration in Binary Search Tree constructor while making its object.

Now you can make different types of Binary Search Trees using new keyword as shown below.

*   ```javascript
    const my_Binary_Search_Tree = new domes.BinarySearchTree(1,1);
    ```
*   ```javascript
    const my_Binary_Search_Tree = new domes.BinarySearchTree(2,1);
    ```
*   ```javascript
    const my_Binary_Search_Tree = new domes.BinarySearchTree(2,2);
    ```

In addition we are using the concept of ID in these as values can be redundant so in order to specify which node we are targeting we have to specify its unique ID.

> **How these IDs are allocated ?**
* When you are normally inserting values IDs are automatically given. For e.g, inserting the first node i.e. the root node will have ID=1 and second node will have ID=2 and so on.
* But when we delete a node these IDs are automatically reshuffled in order as per the BFS order of the resultant tree build after deletion of node. For e.g, if after deletion your BFS order of nodes is ['This','is','my','BFS'] this array (this is array of node values in BST in BFS order) then the IDs will be 1 for 'This', 2 for 'is', 3 for 'my', 4 for 'BFS'. So as you can see it reshuffled the IDs for the nodes. So you can clearly figure out that our root node will always have ID=1.

> **IMPORTANT**
* As you will see in many of our methods it will ask you to provide ID as a parameter and if the method involves a task that will be performed on the whole tree e.g. BFS or DFS etc, these tasks are performed on whole tree and you are just asked to provide the root node, So in these type of methods you can provide any valid ID and the node with that ID will be treated as root node even if it is not of the main tree, Hence these type of methods can also work on ***Sub Trees*** as well.

> ***Keep in mind - Values are accepted as per the configuration.***

> Parameter number/alphabet can be derived as argument number. E.g. 1/a means first argument, 2/b means 2nd argument... etc.

# Graphs

We have divided graphs into four categories :-

* UWUD Graph (Unweighted Undirected Graph).
* UWD Graph (Unweighted Directed Graph).
* WUD Graph (Weighted Undirected Graph).
* WD Graph (Weighted Directed Graph).

We are storing two things in our Graph Node.

* **Value** - This can be anything apart from undefined.
* **ID** - This is what we are using to identify nodes uniquely. In graphs we are giving these IDs by ourself unlike in Binary Search Tree where these are automatically handled.

***Important -*** **You can derive these ID as vertex in the graph.**

We have two formats of storing these IDs

1. Number
2. String

So while making any type of graph we have to specify the format of ID by passing an argument in the constructor of graph in order to configure i.e. 1 for ID in number format, 2 for ID in string format.
